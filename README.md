# 🐾 Vet Clinic Management App

A modern React-based application to manage veterinary patients, built with
**TypeScript**, **Material UI**, **Zustand**, and **React Hook Form**.

This project simulates a real-world clinic dashboard where users can **add,
update, delete, and visualize patients' information**, making it a practical and
relevant solution for small veterinary clinics or educational purposes.
